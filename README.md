# Static-Node.js-and-Express-Site-Project-6

Thank you for taking time to look at my project! I look forawrd to your feed back. I am going for "exceeds expecations." As a result:

1. an error.pug template has been created.
2. when the app is directed at a non-existent route, like /error/error, the app displays a user friendly error page in the browser that details the following:
   error.message
   error.status
   error.stack
3. the project styles has the items below customized. The orignal CSS properties were commented out to make identifying changes easier.
   color
   background color
   font
   text shadows

Thank you again for time and expertise.

Best,
Brandon Rowe
